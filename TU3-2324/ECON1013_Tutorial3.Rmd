## Exercise 1

**Redfield \& Wilton Strategies**

+ Population Sampled: Eligible Voters in Scotland.
+ Sample Size: $1,054$
+ $51\%$ of survey respondents now say they would vote "`No`".

(a) Compute the margin of error (ME) of the proportion saying "`No`" at the $95\%$ confidence level.
(b) Compute the confidence interval at the $95\%$ level.
(c) Suppose I read from somewhere that the ME of that same survey is $2.5\%$. Is this ME at a higher or at a lower confidence level?

## Exercise 1

**Ipsos**

+ Population Sampled: Eligible Voters in Scotland.
+ Sample Size: $1,004$
+ 54% of voters back "`Yes`" $\rightarrow$ The fraction for "`No`" in the Ipsos poll is $0.46$.

(d) Compute the margin of error (ME) of the proportion saying "`No`" at the $95\%$ confidence level. 
(e) What is your view on the differences between the two polls?

## Where we currently are

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.pos = 'H'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/duongtrinh/Dropbox/GTA/ECON1013/GTA-ECON1013-IntroStats/TU3-2324/pictures/CI_BriefReview-Ex1.png")
```

## (a) Compute the margin of error (ME) of the proportion saying "`No`" at the $95\%$ confidence level.

The formula for the margin of error for a population proportion $\hat{p}$ is given by

$$
\color{red}{ME = z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}}
$$

+ $z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$: the value which cuts off $(\frac{\alpha}{2})\cdot 100\%$ of the probability mass in the right tail for a variable following a standard normal distribution.
  + Because the confidence level is $1-\alpha=0.95$, we have that $\alpha=0.05$ and $\frac{\alpha}{2}=0.025$.
  
+ Compute $z_{0.025}$
  + Looking at a statistical table: $z_{0.025} = 1.96$, OR
  + Using `Excel` function: $=\text{NORM.INV}(0.975,0,1)$

## (a) Compute the margin of error (ME) of the proportion saying "`No`" at the $95\%$ confidence level.
Plugging in $z_{0.025} = 1.96$, the sample size $n = 1054$ and the sample proportion $\hat{p} = 0.51$, we find
$$
ME = 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{0.51(1-0.51)}{1054}} = 1.96 \cdot{0.0153} \approx 0.03
$$

$\Rightarrow$ The margin of error is approximately $3\%$ at the $95\%$ confidence level.

## (b) Compute the confidence interval at the $95\%$ level.

The confidence interval is given by
$$
\hat{p} \pm ME
$$

$0.51 \pm 0.03$ gives the interval $[0.48,0.54]$.

## (c) Suppose I read from somewhere that the ME of that same survey is $2.5\%$. Is this ME at a higher or at a lower confidence level?

+ Confidence level = $1-\alpha$

\quad\quad\quad $\alpha$ is smaller $\Leftrightarrow$ Confidence level is higher.

+ $ME = z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$

\quad\quad\quad $\alpha$ is smaller $\Leftrightarrow$ $z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is $\ldots$ $\Leftrightarrow$ ME is $\ldots$.

## {-}

If we compare $z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ for different values of $\alpha$, we see the following:

$z_{\frac{0.10}{2}} = 1.64$,

$z_{\frac{0.05}{2}} = 1.96$,

$z_{\frac{0.01}{2}} = 2.58$,

We see that when $\alpha$ is smaller, $z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is bigger.

## (c) Is this $ME=2.5\%$ at a higher or at a lower confidence level?

+ Confidence level = $1-\alpha$

\quad\quad\quad $\alpha$ is smaller $\Leftrightarrow$ Confidence level is higher. \quad\quad  (1)

+ $ME = z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$

\quad\quad\quad $\alpha$ is smaller $\Leftrightarrow$ $z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is bigger $\Leftrightarrow$ ME is larger. \quad  (2)

\pause

+ From (1) and (2)

\quad\quad\quad \textcolor{red}{ME is larger} $\color{red}{\Leftrightarrow}$ \textcolor{red}{Confidence level is higher.}

\pause

Since we found $\text{ME} = 3\%$ at the $95\%$ confidence level, when ME is $2.5\%$ (lower), the confidence level has to be **lower**.

## (d) Compute the margin of error (ME) of the proportion saying "`No`" at the $95\%$ confidence level. 

\pause

+ The margin of error

$$
\color{red}{ME = z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow ME = 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{0.46(1-0.46)}{1004}} \approx 0.031
$$

+ The $95\%$ confidence level is approximately $[0.429,0.491]$.

## (e) What is your view on the differences between the two polls?

\pause

+ The confidence intervals are clearly different: $[0.429, 0.491]$ is different from $[0.48, 0.54]$, and in this sense, the estimates do differ.

+ However, at the same time, the intervals overlap (for example, $49\%$ is contained in both), so they are not necessarily making different statements about the population parameter.

+ **Remark**: There exist statistical tests to determine whether *two sample averages* are different from each other in a statistically
significant way. We will learn about statistical testing procedures
in Unit 5.

## Exercise 2

The government introduces a housing benefit of $100$ pounds per month for low-income households.

After the introduction of the policy, we collect a sample of rents paid
by $31$ low-income households: $(r_1, r_2, \ldots , r_{31})$. In this sample, the
sample average rent is $\bar{r} = 709$ pounds. In this sample, the standard
deviation is $s_r = 34$.

(a) Construct the margin of error for $\bar{r}$.
(b) Construct the $95\%$ confidence interval for $\bar{r}$.
(c) We know that the average rent paid by low-income households, prior to the reform, was $700$ pounds. Is this value, $700$, still a likely population rent after the reform, based on the sample?

## Where we currently are

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.pos = 'H'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/duongtrinh/Dropbox/GTA/ECON1013/GTA-ECON1013-IntroStats/TU3-2324/pictures/CI_BriefReview-Ex2.png")
```

## (a) Construct the margin of error for $\bar{r}$.

The margin of error of the sample mean for a sample of size $n$, when the population standard deviation is not known, is given by

$$
\color{red}{ME = t_{n-1, \frac{\alpha}{2}} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$

+ $t_{n-1, \frac{\alpha}{2}}$: the value which cuts off $(\frac{\alpha}{2})\cdot 100\%$ of the probability mass in the right tail for a variable following a t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.
  + We use the Student’s t distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.
  + Because $1-\alpha=0.95$, we have that $\alpha=0.05$ and $\frac{\alpha}{2}=0.025$. 
+ Calculate $t_{30, 0.025}$:
  + Looking at a statistical table: $t_{30, 0.025} = 2.042$, OR
  + Using `Excel` function: $=\text{T.INV}(0.975,30)$

## (a) Construct the margin of error for $\bar{r}$.

Plugging in $t_{30, 0.025} = 2.042$, the sample size $n = 31$ and the sample standard deviation $s = 34$, we find

$$
ME = 2.042 \times \frac{34}{\sqrt{31}} \approx 12.47
$$

## (b) Construct the $95\%$ confidence interval for $\bar{r}$.

\pause

$\bar{r} =709$ $\Rightarrow$ $\bar{r} \pm 12.47$ give the confidence interval $[696.5,721.5]$.

## (c) We know that the average rent paid by low-income households, prior to the reform, was $700$ pounds. Is this value, $700$, still a likely population rent after the reform, based on the sample?

\pause

$700$ is contained in the $95\%$ confidence interval. Therefore we don’t have very strong evidence suggesting that $700$ is not a possible value for the population mean after the reform, at the $95\%$ confidence level.
